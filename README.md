# Pixelbot 2.0

A Discord bot based off of the original bot I made [https://github.com/BigHecc6/pixelbotDiscord]

What does this bot have over the original?

Well...

* Updated to Discord.js v13
* Uses slash commands instead of normal commands
* Utilizes the new features in v13 (Select menus, buttons, etc.)
* Optimized and much more readable code
* Event handling
* *Functional* music commands
* Games (Coming soon...)
* Support for multiple servers
* Environment variable to hold the token (DICKSWORD)
* And much more!
